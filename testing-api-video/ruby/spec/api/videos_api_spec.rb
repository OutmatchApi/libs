  # unit tests for l_ist_videos
  # List all videos
  # Requests to this endpoint return a list of your videos (with all their details). With no parameters added to this query, the API returns all videos. You can filter what videos the API returns using the parameters described below.  We have [several tutorials](https://api.video/blog/endpoints/video-list) that demonstrate this endpoint.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :title The title of a specific video you want to find. The search will match exactly to what term you provide and return any videos that contain the same term as part of their titles.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :tags A tag is a category you create and apply to videos. You can search for videos with particular tags by listing one or more here. Only videos that have all the tags you list will be returned.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :metadata Videos can be tagged with metadata tags in key:value pairs. You can search for videos with specific key value pairs using this parameter. [Dynamic Metadata](https://api.video/blog/endpoints/dynamic-metadata) allows you to define a key that allows any value pair.
  # @option opts [String] :description If you described a video with a term or sentence, you can add it here to return videos containing this string.
  # @option opts [String] :live_stream_id If you know the ID for a live stream, you can retrieve the stream by adding the ID for it here.
  # @option opts [String] :sort_by Allowed: publishedAt, title. You can search by the time videos were published at, or by title.
  # @option opts [String] :sort_order Allowed: asc, desc. asc is ascending and sorts from A to Z. desc is descending and sorts from Z to A.
  # @option opts [Integer] :current_page Choose the number of search results to return per page. Minimum value: 1
  # @option opts [Integer] :page_size Results per page. Allowed values 1-100, default is 25.

  # Update a video
  # Use this endpoint to update the parameters associated with your video. The video you are updating is determined by the video ID you provide in the path. For each parameter you want to update, include the update in the request body. NOTE: If you are updating an array, you must provide the entire array as what you provide here overwrites what is in the system rather than appending to it. Tutorials using [video update](https://api.video/blog/endpoints/video-update).

  # unit tests for p_ost_video
  # Create a video
  # To create a video, you create its container&amp;parameters first, before adding the video file (exception - when using an existing HTTP source). * Videos are public by default. [Learn about Private videos](https://api.video/blog/tutorials/tutorial-private-videos) * Up to 6 responsive video streams will be created (from 240p to 4k) * Mp4 encoded versions are created at the highest quality (max 1080p) by default. * Panoramic videos are for videos recorded in 360 degrees.  You can toggle this after your 360 video upload. * Searchable parameters: title, description, tags and metadata   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;shell $ curl https://ws.api.video/videos \\ -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer {access_token} \\ -d &#39;{\&quot;title\&quot;:\&quot;My video\&quot;,       \&quot;description\&quot;:\&quot;so many details\&quot;,      \&quot;mp4Support\&quot;:true }&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;    ## add an URL to upload on creation You can also create a video directly from a video hosted on a third-party server by giving its URI in &#x60;source&#x60; parameter: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;shell $ curl https://ws.api.video/videos \\ -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer {access_token} \\ -d &#39;{\&quot;source\&quot;:\&quot;http://uri/to/video.mp4\&quot;, \&quot;title\&quot;:\&quot;My video\&quot;}&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  In this case, the service will respond &#x60;202 Accepted&#x60; and ingest the video asynchronously. ## Track users with Dynamic Metadata Metadata values can be a key:value where the values are predefined, but Dynamic metadata allows you to enter *any* value for a defined key.  To defined a dynamic metadata pair use: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; \&quot;metadata\&quot;:[{\&quot;dynamicKey\&quot;: \&quot;__dynamicKey__\&quot;}] &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  The double underscore on both sides of the value allows any variable to be added for a given video session. Added the the url you might have: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; &lt;iframe type&#x3D;\&quot;text/html\&quot; src&#x3D;\&quot;https://embed.api.video/vod/vi6QvU9dhYCzW3BpPvPsZUa8?metadata[classUserName]&#x3D;Doug\&quot; width&#x3D;\&quot;960\&quot; height&#x3D;\&quot;320\&quot; frameborder&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot; scrollling&#x3D;\&quot;no\&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;   This video session will be tagged as watched by Doug - allowing for in-depth analysis on how each viewer interacts with the videos. ### We have tutorials on: * [Creating and uploading videos](https://api.video/blog/tutorials/video-upload-tutorial) * [Uploading large videos](https://api.video/blog/tutorials/video-upload-tutorial-large-videos)   * [Using tags with videos](https://api.video/blog/tutorials/video-tagging-best-practices) * [Private videos](https://api.video/blog/tutorials/tutorial-private-videos) * [Using Dynamic Metadata](https://api.video/blog/tutorials/dynamic-metadata)  * Full list of [tutorials](https://api.video/blog/endpoints/video-create) that demonstrate this endpoint.
