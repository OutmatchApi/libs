/**

 * @param events A list of the webhooks that you are subscribing to. There are Currently four webhook options: * ```video.encoding.quality.completed```  When a new video is uploaded into your account, it will be encoded into several different HLS sizes/bitrates.  When each version is encoded, your webhook will get a notification.  It will look like ```{ \\\"type\\\": \\\"video.encoding.quality.completed\\\", \\\"emittedAt\\\": \\\"2021-01-29T16:46:25.217+01:00\\\", \\\"videoId\\\": \\\"viXXXXXXXX\\\", \\\"encoding\\\": \\\"hls\\\", \\\"quality\\\": \\\"720p\\\"} ```. This request says that the 720p HLS encoding was completed. * ```live-stream.broadcast.started```  When a livestream begins broadcasting, the broadcasting parameter changes from false to true, and this webhook fires. * ```live-stream.broadcast.ended```  This event fores when the livestream has finished broadcasting, and the broadcasting parameter flips from false to true. * ```video.source.recorded```  This event is similar to ```video.encoding.quality.completed```, but tells you if a livestream has been recorded as a VOD.
 * @param url The the url to which HTTP notifications are sent. It could be any http or https URL.
